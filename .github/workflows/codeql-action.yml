        # CodeQL supports the following values keywords for 'language': $supported-codeql-languages
        # Use `c-cpp` to analyze code written in C, C++ or both
        # Use 'java-kotlin' to analyze code written in Java, Kotlin or both
        # Use 'javascript-typescript' to analyze code written in JavaScript, TypeScript or both
        # To learn more about changing the languages that are analyzed or customizing the build mode for your analysis,

        # If you are analyzing a compiled language, you can modify the 'build-mode' for that language to customize how
        # your codebase is analyzed, see https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/creating-an-advanced-setup-for-code-scanning/codeql-code-scanning-for-compiled-languages
